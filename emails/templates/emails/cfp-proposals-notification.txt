Hi {{ recipient.name }},

{% if recipient.submitted_single_proposal %}
  Thank you for submitting your proposal to the PyCon UK Call for Participation:

  {% for proposal in recipient.proposals.all %}
  * {{ proposal.title }} ({{ propsal.session_type_for_display }}){% endfor %}

  {% if recipient.all_proposals_accepted %}
    We are pleased to tell you that we would like to accept your proposal.
  {% else %}
    We are sorry to tell you that we were unable to find room in the schedule for
    your session.  We received many excellent proposals, and are sad not to have
    been able to schedule more of them.

    {% if recipient.get_grant_application %}
      I regret also that we have been to meet your request for financial assistance,
      as we have received applications for several times more than the amount of our
      financial assistance budget.

    assistance applications has passed, but if you are unable to attend the
    conference without a free ticket, please let us know immediately.
