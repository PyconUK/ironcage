Hi {{ recipient.name }},

This email contains details about giving your poster at PyCon UK.

The poster session will take place outside the Lower Hall on Saturday lunchtime.
If you are exhibiting a poster, please come to the registration desk with your
poster during the morning break on Saturday.

You should feel free to leave your poster, skip any queues, and grab your own
lunch during the poster session!

If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know by replying to this email!

And thank you, on behalf of the whole Python community in the UK, for the work
you're doing to make the conference a success.
