Hi {{ recipient.name }},

As you've not yet told us whether you've arranged accommodation in Cardiff
during the conference, we wanted to let you know that we've made reservations
for around 200 beds for conference delegates in hostels in Cardiff.

More details are on our website: http://2017.pyconuk.org/accommodation/.

Once you have made arrangements, please let us know by updating your conference
profile https://hq.pyconuk.org/profile/.

All the best

~ The PyCon UK Committee
