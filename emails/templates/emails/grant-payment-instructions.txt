Hi {{ recipient.name }},

Here are some instructions for claiming financial assistance to attend PyCon
UK.

We prefer to disburse grants immediately after the conference.  However we
realise that some travellers will need the funds in advance.  If that's the
case for you, please let us know straight away, so that we can make the
necessary arrangements.

Our preferred means of payment is by bank transfer to a UK bank account, but we
should be able to make transfers to banks overseas.  Please send us:

 * your full bank account details (for a UK bank, this would be your sort code
   and account number), and the address of your bank
 * your own address (as given on your bank account)

If you have not already booked accommodation in Cardiff for the duration of the
conference, you will find that your options are limited.  This is because of a
heavyweight boxing match that may be taking place in Cardiff on October 28th.
There are details about accommodation options on our website[0].

Additionally, the conference committee have made some block bookings for
dormitories at a couple of hostels in central Cardiff, and we can assign you a
bed there if you need it.  We'll publish more details of this soon.

Finally, if you are travelling from outside the UK, you may need a visa to
attend the conference.  If this is the case, we are happy to write a letter in
support of your visa application.

If you have any questions, please let us know.

Best wishes,

~ The PyCon UK committee
