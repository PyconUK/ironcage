Hi {{ recipient.name }},

We've noticed that you've chosen a vegan starter and vegan main for the
conference dinner on Friday.

There's now a vegan dessert (Alabama fudge cake with fruits of the forest)
available.  If you'd like to have that, please let us know by 18:00 on
Wednesday if you'd like to have that instead of the tangy lemon tart with
strawberry & blackpepper ice cream.
