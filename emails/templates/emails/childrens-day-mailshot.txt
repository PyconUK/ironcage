Dear {{ name }},

We hope you remember the young person's programming day from last year's
PyCon UK.

Well, we're back!

On Saturday 28th October, at Cardiff City Hall, we're running two types
of event suitable for young people: A Code Club
(https://www.codeclub.org.uk/), for primary school aged children, and, a
Raspberry Jam (https://www.raspberrypi.org/jam/) for secondary aged
children. Both events will be run in collaboration with the Raspberry Pi
Foundation (https://www.raspberrypi.org/) - the world's most successful
computing education project in history.

Young people will be introduced to a number of fun, engaging and
inspiring age-appropriate activities relating to programming with the
Python programming language. In the afternoon they'll be given an
opportunity to use their new skills to create exciting projects of their
own design. At the end of the day, those who want to will be able to
present their projects to the rest of PyCon UK (the national conference
for programmers who use Python).

Attendees must be accompanied by an adult at all times and everyone
(including adults) get lunch provided.

All this for just Â£5 per person..! Book now since tickets are selling
out fast.

We hope to see you at PyCon UK!

Best wishes,

The PyCon UK Education Track Team.
