Hi {{ recipient.name }},

We mentioned in an email last week that we have published a provisional
day-by-day schedule for PyCon UK 2017, which you can find our website at
http://2017.pyconuk.org/schedule/.

We'd like to minimise further changes to the schedule; so if you can't speak on
the day that you've been assigned, please let us know by replying to this email
by the end of Sunday 10th September.

Best wishes,

~ The PyCon UK Committee
