Hi {{ recipient.name }},

I had hoped that we'd be able to announce our decisions about the PyCon UK
schedule this evening, but it's getting late and I'm struggling to get a Django
ORM query to Do The Right Thing.

Rather than risk messing it up, I'm going to sleep on it and get somebody else
on the committee to review my code in the morning, so please expect a
notification by email tomorrow.

In the meantime, thank you for your submission or submissions, and thank you
for your understanding.

Peter Inglesby
PyCon UK conference chair
