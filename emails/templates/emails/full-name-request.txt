Hi {{ recipient.name }},

We're contacting you because you're coming to PyCon UK, but you've not told us
your full name.  Most people have their full name on their badge, although we
understand that this is not appropriate for everybody.

Badges are being sent to the printer at 08:00 BST on Monday morning, so if
you'd like your full name on your badge, please update your profile at
https://hq.pyconuk.org/profile/edit/ (or send us an email).

Thanks!

~ The PyCon UK Committee
