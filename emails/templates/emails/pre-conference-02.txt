Hi {{ recipient.name }},

With two weeks to go until PyCon UK opens, we wanted to tell you a bit more
about what's happening at the conference.

You can view the details of your ticket at:

    https://hq.pyconuk.org/tickets/tickets/{{ recipient.ticket.ticket_id }}/

~~~

Timetable
---------

Each day, the registration desk opens at 08:00.  You only need to register
once!  We're expecting a lot of people to turn up on Thursday morning, so
please arrive as soon after 08:00 as you can.  We'll be providing tea and
coffee in the Lower Hall during the registration period.

Each day's activities begin at 09:00 in the Assembly Room.  From Thursday to
Sunday, there are talks and workshops scheduled until 18:30.  On Monday, we
will finish at 16:00.

You can find a full schedule on our website:

please let us know by completing your profile in our ticketing system:

(In fact, it'd be helpful if you could tell us if you don't have any special
requirements too!)


Children's day
--------------

There are still a handful of tickets left for the children's day on Saturday
28th:

Conference dinner
-----------------

There will be a conference dinner at City Hall on the Friday of the conference.
Tickets will go on sale at 09:00 on Monday 16th, and we expect them to sell
out.


Poster session
--------------

We're running a poster session over Saturday lunchtime, and we still have a few
spaces for posters.

If you'd like to exhibit a poster, please let us know.


Jobs fair
---------

On Sunday lunchtime, there'll be the chance to meet with companies who are
looking to recruit Python programmers.  If you're looking for work, or might be
soon, you should bring along some copies of your CV.


Lightning talks
---------------

Each evening, we're hosting an hour-long lightning talk session.  This is a
chance to give a five-minute talk to the whole conference on any topic.  You'll
be able to sign up at the registration desk from Thursday lunchtime onwards,
and slots will be allocated on a first-come first-served basis.


Sprints
-------

Monday is a day of code sprints, and is a chance to work alongside other
programmers on open source projects.

Sprints are organised on an ad-hoc basis.  If you'd like to run one, you just
need to turn up on the Monday!

Volunteering

We're looking for volunteers to help out during the conference with the
following:

* Setting up the venue at 06:00 on Thursday †
* Chairing sessions
* Videoing talks
* Staffing the reception desk

† There's a wedding the day before, so we've got an early start -- if you
volunteer for this we'll give you breakfast!

If you'd like to volunteer, please answer the relevant questions on your
profile:

Code of Conduct

PyCon UK has a code of conduct, and we expect all attendees to honour it:

    http://2017.pyconuk.org/code-of-conduct/

Should you experience harassment, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the conference
committee:

John Pinner Award
-----------------

This year, we have instituted the John Pinner Awards to celebrate those who
volunteer their services to the Python Community.

John founded and organised PyCon UK until he passed away in 2015.  He was the
personification of a Pythonista who gave time, code and effort back to the
community. He was a role model, mentor and teacher who is sorely missed by
many.

If you would like to nominate somebody to receive an award, please do so here:

    http://2017.pyconuk.org/pinner-award/


Conference swag
---------------

Instead of giving them away as we have done in previous years, we're selling
mugs, t-shirts, and more, through our online shop:

    https://shop.spreadshirt.co.uk/pyconuk/

All proceeds will go towards the financial assistance budget for 2018.

If you want your swag to arrive in time for the start of the conference, you
should order now!
