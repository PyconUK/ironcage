Hi {{ recipient.name }},

We're in the last stages of putting the conference schedule together, and we'd
like your help to identify which talks are going to be most popular, so that we
can allocate them to the largest room.

If you have some spare time this weekend and want to help, all you have to do
is visit https://hq.pyconuk.org/cfp/voting/, where you'll be presented with
some randomly selected talks and asked whether you'd be interested in attending
or not.

Thanks!
