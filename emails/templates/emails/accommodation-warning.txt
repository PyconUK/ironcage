Hi {{ recipient.name }},

There are rumours that a heavyweight boxing match may be taking place in
Cardiff on the Saturday of PyCon UK, and so accommodation in the city has been
snapped up much more quickly this year than usual.

If you're coming to the conference, **you should book your accommodation now**.
Don't delay any further!  If you leave it too late, you may find that there is
no more affordable accommodation available.

We have set up a wiki[0] for people to arrange sharing of rooms or rentals, or for
anybody in Cardiff to offer a room in their home.  (We can offer a free
conference ticket to anybody in Cardiff who can put up visitors in their home.)

Please see the accommodation page on our website for more details.

To help you plan when to come to the conference, we have also released a
provisional list of the talks and workshops that are happening each day[2].

All the best

~ The PyCon UK Committee
