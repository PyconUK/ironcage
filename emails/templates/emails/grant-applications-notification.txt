You have applied for a free ticket for PyCon UK, and we're pleased to tell you

You have applied for financial assistance to attend PyCon UK.  Unfortunately we
are unable to meet your request, as we have received applications for several
times more than the amount of our financial assistance budget.

However, if you can cover your costs of attending the conference, we would like
to offer you a free ticket, and if this is the case, please write to the
committee at pyconuk-enquiries@python.org.

{% elif application.amount_requested == application.amount_offered %}
You have applied for financial assistance to attend PyCon UK, and we're pleased
to tell you that we can offer you the full amount (£{{ application.amount_offered }}) and a free ticket.

We will send instructions for claiming your grant and ticket in the next few days.

You have applied for financial assistance to attend PyCon UK.  Unfortunately we

attendance.

We will send instructions for claiming your grant and ticket in the next few days.
