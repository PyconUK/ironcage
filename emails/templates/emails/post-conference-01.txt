Hi everyone!

First, thanks for coming to this year's conference. We hope you enjoyed it as
much as we did.

We'd like to make next year's conference even better, and it's important we
hear your views on what we did well and what we could improve on. Therefore, we
would be grateful if you could fill out this quick feedback form and let us
know what you thought:

We're busy working on plans for next year already, and hope to be able to share
them with you soon, along with our plans for the UK Python Association charity.
You can keep in touch via our websites: uk.python.org, pyconuk.org and via

Once again thank you all for coming, and we look forward to seeing you again
next year!

All the best,
