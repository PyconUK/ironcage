Hi {{ recipient.name }},

This email contains details about giving your talk at PyCon UK.


Schedule
--------

You should by now have seen the conference schedule, which is on the
website[0].  Please make sure that you know when and where your talk is!

The schedule won't change now without a very good reason, and if we do have to
move your session, we'll let you know.


Giving your talk
----------------

You'll have a session chair who will introduce you, help you keep to time, and
help you with questions (if you choose to take them).  We're still arranging
chairs, but we'll introduce you to your chair by email beforehand.

You will have twenty five minutes for your talk, which may include questions if
you would like to take them.  

We will be filming almost all the talks, and will put the videos on YouTube.
If you would not like your talk to be filmed, please let us know.

Speakers in the Assembly Room, Ferrier Hall, and Room D will have access to an
HDMI projector.  All other speakers will have a VGA projector.

If you're speaking in the Assembly Room, your talk will be transcribed and
displayed on screens around the room.  The stenographers (who are used to local
council meetings and company AGMs!) have requested that we tell them in advance
about any unusual words that may come up.  If you'll be using any technincal
terms, please let us know and we'll pass them on.

If you would like to make any changes to the talk description on our website,
either make a pull request against the website repo[1], or drop us an email.


Green room
----------

Room 136 will be available for speakers, and stocked with water and hot drinks
throughout the conference.  Please make use of it if you need somewhere to
prepare.


Contributors' dinner
--------------------

You should already have received an invitation to the contributors' dinner, but
if not, please tell us whether you're coming via the ticketing system[2].


Finally...
----------

If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know by replying to this email!

And thank you, on behalf of the whole Python community in the UK, for the work
you're doing to make the conference a success.

~ The PyCon UK Committee
