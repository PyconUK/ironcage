Hi {{ recipient.name }},

As a contributor to the conference, you're invited to the contributors' dinner
on Sunday evening at the Clink, but you haven't told us you're coming yet.

If you can't make the Sunday evening, then we'd like to invite you to the
conference dinner on the Friday evening instead.

There are only a handful of places left for the contributors' dinner, and
orders for the conference dinner close at 15:00 on Tuesday afternoon, so please
don't hang about!
