Hi {{ recipient.name }},

As you may have gathered, we're concerned about availability of accommodation
in Cardiff during PyCon UK.  It would be helpful for us if you could tell us
whether you've already arranged accommodation.  Please could you do this AS
SOON AS POSSIBLE at https://hq.pyconuk.org/profile/edit/.

More details about accommodation are on our website:
http://2017.pyconuk.org/accommodation/.

All the best

~ The PyCon UK Committee
