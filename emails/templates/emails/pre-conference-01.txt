Hi {{ recipient.name }},

We're looking forwards to seeing you at PyCon UK in Cardiff in October.

This email contains some practicalities about the conference.

Hotels
------

We understand that some Cardiff hotels are getting booked up over the
conference weekend.  We have put together a list of hotels in central
Cardiff[1], and if you have not already booked a room, we encourage you to do
so soon!


Accessibility, childcare, and dietary requirements
--------------------------------------------------

It is important to us that the conference is inclusive of the whole community.
If you have any particular accessibility, childcare, or dietary requirements,
please let us know by filling in your profile in the conference HQ[2].

You can read more about our approach to diversity, accessibility, and inclusion
on our website[3].


Conference programme
--------------------

This evening we announced details of our keynote speakers[4], and we'll be
announcing the full programme soon.

If you submitted a proposal to our Call for Participation, or an application
for financial assistance, you should hear from us by the end of the weekend.


Staying in touch
----------------

You can keep up with the latest from the conference committee by subscribing to
UK Python News[5], and following us on Twitter[6].


See you in Cardiff!

~ The PyCon UK Committee
