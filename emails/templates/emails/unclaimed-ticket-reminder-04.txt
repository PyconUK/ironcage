Evening things
--------------

On Thursday evening, the London Python Code Dojo team are running a Code Dojo.
This is a chance to tackle a coding challenge as part of a team.  It's not a
competition, and beginners and less experienced coders are encouraged to join
in.

On Saturday evening, we're hosting an evening of board games.  If you have a
game you'd like to play, please bring it along!

    http://2017.pyconuk.org/board-games/

At both events, there will be pizza for sale and a cash bar.

Places to both are limited, so if you're planning to come, please let us know
by updating your profile:

Accommodation
-------------

If you're having trouble finding somewhere to stay please see the accommodation
page as we have made some arrangements with local hostels who may still be able
to put you up.
