Hi {{ recipient.name }},

This email contains details about giving your workshop at PyCon UK.


Schedule
--------

You should by now have seen the conference schedule, which is on the
website[0].  Please make sure that you know when and where your workshop is!

The schedule won't change now without a very good reason, and if we do have to
move your session, we'll let you know.

Giving your workshop
--------------------

You'll be responsible for starting your workshop, but somebody from the
committee will look in on you towards the start of your session to make sure
everything's OK.

The room will be laid out with chairs around round tables, with a VGA projector
and screen.

Most workshops are scheduled over breaks.  Please let your attendees go and
grab a coffee!

You should not assume that the conference wifi will be good enough for all
attendees to be able to download resources from the internet, so you should
update the workshop description on the website to include any installation
instructions.  To do this, make a pull request against the website repo[1], or
send us an email.


Green room
----------

Room 136 will be available for speakers, and stocked with water and hot drinks
throughout the conference.  Please make use of it if you need somewhere to
prepare.


Contributors' dinner
--------------------

You should already have received an invitation to the contributors' dinner, but
if not, please tell us whether you're coming via the ticketing system[2].


Finally...
----------

If you have any questions or concerns, please let us know by replying to this email!

And thank you, on behalf of the whole Python community in the UK, for the work
you're doing to make the conference a success.

~ The PyCon UK Committee
