Hi {{ recipient.name }},

As a ticket holder for this year's PyCon UK, we wanted to tell you about the UK
Python Association, a newly-formed charity whose purpose is support the Python
community in the UK.  You can read more about the UKPA on the conference
website[1].

The UKPA is a membership organisation, and anybody who attends PyCon UK 2017 is
entitled to membership.  For now, membership entitles you to vote to elect the
organisation's trustees.  You can indicate that you would like to join the UKPA
when you fill out your profile[2].

We are looking to elect up to six trustees for the UKPA at the first AGM on the
Saturday of the conference.  The trustees will be responsible for the charity's
management and administration, and will be responsible for appointing a chair
for PyCon UK 2018.

If you would like to put yourself forward for election as a trustee, please
complete the nomination form[3] by Thursday 12th October.

If you have any questions, please get in touch: trustees@uk.python.org.

See you in Cardiff!

~ The PyCon UK Committee
