Hi {{ recipient.name }},

When you submitted your proposal to PyCon UK, you requested a mentor.
Unfortunately, we haven't had the capacity to organise a proper mentorship
programme this year, and we're sorry about that.

However if you'd like somebody to look over your slides or discuss something
else relating to your session, please reply to this email and we'll put you in
touch with somebody who can help.
