Hi {{ recipient.name }},

We're looking forward to your talk at PyCon UK, but you don't appear to have a
ticket for the conference yet.  Ticket sales close at 23:59 BST on Monday
(that's tomorrow!).

If you have one (perhaps with a different account to the account that you used
to submit your talk proposal), then please reply to this email with your ticket
reference number.

Otherwise, you can buy a ticket by visiting:

All the best

~ The PyCon UK Committee
